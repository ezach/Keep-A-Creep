## YAML Template.
# NOTE: root is the main command. (should we change this to the actual base command?)
# NOTE: keep all commands lower case.
# Key:
# Main: - if this command meets all requirements, then this number actually runs the command.
# Sub: - list of sub commands which hop off this command: /cmd main sub value
# Info: - command to run if this is not a full command (info msg or similar)
# PNode: - the node(s) this command requires to pass.
# PError: - the command for when we fail the permission test.
# Args: - number of arguments we're expecting. <0 means an instant fail
# OptArgs: - extra number of possible optional args this command may have.
# Fail: - what to do if the command generally fails (incorrect subcommands, arg length etc.) WE NEED THIS! will default to 0.
# TODO: others.
# TODO: need some kind of permission tree.
